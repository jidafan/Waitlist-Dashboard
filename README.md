## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to showcase the waitlist of a hospital between the years 2018 and 2021. In this dashboard, we seek to show the current status of the patient waitlist, analyze the monthly trend in the waitlists of inpatients vs outpatients, and provide analysis on specialties and age profiles. 

## Data Review

The data contains information on the inpatients and outpatients at a hospital. Inpatients are patients who stay in a hospital under treatment and outpatients are patients who receive treatment without being admitted to the hospital. The data covers the years 2018 - 2021 and shows information regarding the age profile of the patient, the date of their visit, and other valuable information to the hospital.
